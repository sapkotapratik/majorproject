Final Year Project - Class of 2020

**Project Conclusion**

 Various data mining methods such as tokenization, stop word removal, and word stemming were
used for data preprocessing of the collected dataset. As for feature extraction, Count Vectorizer
and TF-IDF Vectorizer were used in Na ̈ıve Bayes and Support Vector Machine ( SVM) respectively. 
Accuracy rate, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were considered for performance evaluation of the system. 
Because of the imbalance in the distribution of categories in the dataset, SMOTE was used to improve the model 
performance which increased the accuracy of Naıve Bayes by nearly 3%. Meanwhile, for SVM, it did not improve the result. 
In comparison, SVM is found to provide the besttesting accuracy of 92.3% for our given dataset.
